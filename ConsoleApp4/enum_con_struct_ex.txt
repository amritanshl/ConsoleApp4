Part 1: Enumerators (enum)
Question 1: Habitat Finder
Create an enum called HabitatType with values for Jungle, Ocean, Desert, and Arctic. Create a class WildAnimal that has a property for Name and its Habitat.

Hint: Use the enum keyword to define the categories before you use them in the class.

Sample Output: The Polar Bear lives in the Arctic.

Question 2: Endangered Status Check
Create an enum called ConservationStatus with values LeastConcern, Vulnerable, and Endangered. Write a method that takes this enum and returns a warning message.

Hint: Use a switch statement to return different strings based on the status.

Sample Output: Alert: The Red Panda is Endangered!

Part 2: Constructors
Question 3: The Zoo Arrival
Create a ZooAnimal class with a Parameterized Constructor that sets the Species and the Weight of the animal when it is registered.

Hint: Use this.Species = species; inside the constructor to map the input parameters to the class fields.

Sample Output: Registered: Elephant, Weight: 5000kg.

Question 4: The Mystery Egg
Create a Bird class with a Default (Parameterless) Constructor. If no species is provided, the bird's species should be set to "Unknown Bird". Also, add a second constructor that allows you to name the species.

Hint: This is Constructor Overloading. One constructor takes a string, the other takes nothing.

Sample Output: A new egg hatched! It is an: Unknown Bird.

Part 3: Structs (struct)
Question 5: Fish Tank Dimensions
Create a struct called TankSize that holds double Length, Width, and Height. Create one tank, copy it to a second variable, and change the second tank's dimensions to show the original doesn't change.

Hint: Because a struct is a Value Type, copying tankA to tankB creates a completely independent copy on the Stack.

Sample Output: Tank 1: 10x10. Tank 2 (resized): 20x20.

Question 6: Animal Speed Tracker
Create a struct called MovementSpeed with properties for TopSpeed and AverageSpeed. Add a method inside the struct called DisplaySpeed() that prints these values.

Hint: Structs are great for small, data-centric objects like speeds, points, or colors.

Sample Output: Cheetah Speed -> Top: 120km/h, Avg: 60km/h.
